## Sharing discovery

Context free notes from various presentations.

- Not everyone wants to grow. At all. Some people just want to solve the problem in front of them and not think particularly further
- Big pharma is most interested in de-risking potential drugs (they frequently don't research lesser known molecules themselves, but are very happy to license appropriate tech from smaller labs once those labs have done groundbreaking work)
- Computational chemists are rare and extremely expensive, so getting one on your board is a pretty strong signal
- Keep in mind that if you've got a lot of calls that you got from a particular platform listing, that platform be affected by selection bias
- Parents mostly don't want to hear feedback or get help, they mostly just want reassurance (that they're doing ok, or that they're not the only ones facing a particular problem)
- The kids are alright
- A couple groups re-derived ["Awkward Silence" and "Tell me more"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/12/34/)
- College students are surprisingly willing to just talk to random old people on campus
- Pricing is weird. Certain verticals just have an assumption that the service is really expensive, so when you tell them what you're looking to sell something for, a common reaction is a sort of "that's too good to be true" suspicion
  - Potential solution is a "try now pay later model"
- Giving freebies is a good way to get peoples' attention (assuming they're actually valuable freebies)
- Some people haven't fully internalized the [typical mind fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy), and are pretty surprised when they see evidence for it
- Sometimes, your idea sucks, and that's ok. You can drop those and move on to better ones.
