## Furniture

I have this very distinct memory from design school. 

Yes, I went to design school, and then promptly said "fuck that" and spent the next 20 years building datastructures and distributed systems instead. Shut up.

I have this very distinct memory from design school wherein we were discussing the history of furniture design. It was part of a longer unit, but the conversation in question involved me watching the entire class, along with the professor, agree that IKEA was trash, and that actually things were _way better_ back in the [Arts and Crafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement) days. Fuck you, Ingvar Kamprad and all hail Gustav Stickley. Now, I'm old, so this was before [Ikea Hacks](https://ikeahackers.net/) made it possible for me to know that my people were out there, but I quietly disagreed. 

At the time I didn't have the language to express why, and I didn't find it until I first heard "funge" used as a verb. As in "what does that funge with"? I agree that the Arts and Crafts movement furniture was in some ways better than what came before; it eschewed the deliberate and vestigial decoration of early machine-made furniture, while still _using_ machinery to better effect than fully hand-made furniture makers ever did.

You can already see where I'm going with this.

IKEA isn't an artistic movement that aimed to capture the human soul. It fails on that metric, although I'm sure you could argue it if you _really_ wanted to. IKEA is better than what came before because it enabled more people than ever to actually have furniture. I'm willing to grant that the ur chair, made created by the kings' master carpenter and three apprentices was better constructed, used more subtle and tasteful materials, and was more soulful in some way, but only the king got to sit on that chair, and if you sat down on it and were able to separate yourself from the cultural significance of the experiment, you'd admit that it was less comfortable than what we've got thanks to modern industrial furniture (unless it was deliberately designed that way; _one_ thing you could say about the kings' chair is that anyone who tried to "hostile architecture" on it ended up beheaded) .

Here's what prompted this. Recently, I noticed AI slop spilling into the real world. My building management office put out this Thanksgiving notice 

(TODO - pic of weird AI slop thanksgiving image)

and I was momentarily offended before I noticed the other notice they put up the week before

(TODO - pic of shitty clipart)

It's hard to conclude that this is bad, given what it funges with.
