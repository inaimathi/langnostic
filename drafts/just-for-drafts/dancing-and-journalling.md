I haven't really been focusing on my programming outside of work. Mainly because I don't want to get burnt out on it[^quite-hot], but also because I haven't really had much focus in terms of end goals. If you go by [populariy](TODO - my popular repos), I should spend the next year or so hacking on [`cl-notebook`](TODO). Which would be a perfectly fine thing to do, except that it would involve putting together a production-ready version of that [web-framework](TODO) I wrote, as well as [`house`](TODO) and [`fact-base`](TODO) besides. Each of those is tangled enough that I'm not sure I want to make the attempt without having a free month ahead of me. And that isn't likely to happen soon, unfortunately.

[^quite-hot]: And, as mentioned, work burns quite hot in that regard.

So, in the absence of any new work, here's a fluffy journal piece. Hey, at least I gave you a heads-up.

## Dancing

The next thing on my "List Of Things I Haven't Learned Yet And Should Probably Get To At Some Point" was dancing. Nestled between "Juggle" and "Play An Instrment". I was going to take up [Salsa](TODO), since that seems to be the thing to do, but a friend of mine recommended I instead try [Zouk](TODO). Which is a younger, more fluid dance style. So I've been taking classes every Thursday for the past little while, and loving every minute of it[^also-social].

[^also-social]: I also made it out to the social last Tuesday, but get the feeling I'll neeed to
