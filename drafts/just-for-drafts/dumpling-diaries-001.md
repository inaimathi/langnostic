Ok, so.

1. Rice flour-dumplings seem to be a lot more fragile than wheat flour ones? It may have been the ratio of rice-flour-to-potato-starch (or just my unskilled hands), but the wheat ones seemed to hold together a lot better.
2. Let them goddamn cool first
3. The bamboo steamer is absolutely, 100% worth it. I now seriously want to try this with a shrimp-based filling, rather than a mushroom/spinach based one. They're a lot chewier than pot-sticker-style dumplings, and I guess I like that? Next time, I might to try browning them on one side first, then steaming to completion. But, the other benefit of steaming is that it's actually a much faster and less attention-needing method of preparation.
4. For fucks' sake, DO NOT EAT ALL OF THE DUMPLINGS IN A BATCH WHEN YOU MAKE THEM. Seriously. I don't care how badly you want to. Eat 6 or 7 at the outside and freeze the rest. It's not worth rubly tummy all night, or the probably weight gain.
