Before I go any further, this one is firmly staying in the drafts folder, because personal stuff and also bullshit that literally no one anywhere cares about.

So I'm a shlepper, I guess?

It sort of makes quasi-sense, because I live in a fundamentally capitalist North American country, and never explicitly thought about reducing the amount of stuff I own besides the occasional, ritualistic, mostly-cosmetic purging of excess excess excess. Now that I've been moving around though, it's pretty obvious that I have way too much stuff. Ideally, it would be possible for me to move to the next place by taking a backpack, a gym bag and maybe a medium-sized suitcase. Even this is shlepping by the [Walkaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Doctorow_novel)) definition, but we haven't exactly reached the level of matter-fungibility as that potential future. I mean, _ideally_ ideally, I'd be able to move with nothing more than a backpack, but that would take either some serious planning, or some serious cheating.

This has me thinking about the nature of minimalism in the context of modern living.

If you're rich enough, it's fairly easy to be a "minimalist" by just renting everything. You can live in an AirBnB/hotel and thus own no furniture. You can treat clothing as disposable. You can eat exclusively at restaurants, and you can move around by some combination of Uber, public transport, bikeshares and your legs. _Technically_, you can own nothing more than a laptop and laptop bag, a phone and a bank account. _Effectively_, you're still taking advantage of all the trappings of modern life and participate in its' supply-chain and economies.

I don't think this is a satisfying standard for "minimalist".

If I want to be a minimalist in the deeper sense, I need to divest myself from as many of these things as I can.

- Organize my life so that it's not dependent on external transport. Mainly, this means living in proximity to everything I need. Groceries/food sources, work and play, to the extent that I can walk or lean on public transit to get anything I need.
- Eat in a simple, self-contained way. Mostly, this means cooking for myself from simple, unprocessed ingredients, using the minimal, most general-purpose set of tools I can train myself to use.
- Exercise in a way that minimizes external tools or requirements. Mostly bodyweight exercises, possibly using simple improvised weights.
- Wear what I can carry. This is the limiting factor I'm hitting at the moment; I kinda need at least a weeks' worth of clothing to make the laundry cycle worth my while. A set of two or three bacteria/scent-shedding clothes would do equally well, but I don't think we've quite reached that tech level as a species quite yet. Note to self regarding putting this together, I guess, look up what high-durability, reusable clothing looks like? It also might be the case that there's an inherent energy imbalance here.
- Finally, have fun and keep sane in a way mirroring my exercise. Minimal external tools or requirements. I have a pretty robust mental model of some of my favorite programming languages and compilers, so that fits the bill, and dancing essentially requires a pair of slippers along with my body. As I move forward and my body decays, I'll probably lean harder on the programming side of being entertained.

These all seem like attainable goals.
