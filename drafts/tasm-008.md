- AI Governance Reading Group Tuesday 27th at 6:30 at the CSI Annex (TODO - meetup link here)
- basically, an EA-centered, less technical version of this group
- "Everyone who attends will be offered the chance to take on a role in the group..."
- Also, reminder, AI Safety regulars can participate in a Zoom-based coding club Mondays at 6:00  (you'll need to be in the AIGS slack; check in with me if you're interested)

## Zvi's Update

- Gemini Advanced; the new Google model, competitive with GPT-4
  - Sometimes tells you how to do a thing rather than actually doing a thing
  - Possibly just not accessible in Canada? (Nope, accessible in Canada. Blog post went up a few hours before the meetup https://blog.google/intl/en-ca/products/explore-get-answers/gemini-ca/)
- There's been a Deepfake heist.
  - Employee emailed about performing a secret, unusual transaction
  - His fears calmed after a video call with what he thought were various colleagues and the CFO
  - Too bad they were actually deepfakes :|
- Quebec needs an AI law
  - They're particularly concerned about the job market but don't want to slow down innovation
- Nomic embedding is a new level of open model https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1
- GPT-4 gives you better responses if you say you'll tip it more? :|

## The Talk - Power Seeking AI

- A variety of methods a power-seeking AI could use to gain more power
- How effective those methods might be
- What steps can we take to reduce their efficacy

Not on today's menu: would an AI become power seeking? Why might it want to power seek?

"Power" is the ability to act or produce an effect. "Power-seeking" is aiming to increase ones' ability to do more things, in particular relative to other actors in a given scenario.

We're _mostly_ talking about autonomous AI agents, but some of this stuff also applies to directed AI.

#### Things to keep in mind
- There is a strong perceived boundary between digital and physical worlds (Max Tegmark gets namedropped by the audience here https://www.amazon.ca/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598). It's not necessarily as strong as percieved.
- Getting shut down is the ultimate loss of power for an AI, so a power seeking AI will likely work hard to avoid this outcome
- Power dynamics can be zero-, positive- or negative-sum
  - Zero-sum: a conflict where someone
  - Positive-sum: a classic peace dividend works here. Two nations/cities/tribes/what-have-you
  - Negative-sum: a war of attrition (all parties are now worse off. Congratulations)
  
#### Hacking Computer Systems
- Advanced AIs would likely be good at it
  - One of the most common methods to use AIs today is in assisting with coding
  - this involves knowing what is and is not secure code, and possibly influencing users towards one of them
- Could grant access to
  - data and information to inform other plans
  - communication channels to manipulate and persuade

Pub topic: Are models actually getting better at coding? How likely are they to get _much_ better here?

#### Control More Resources

- Compute & digital infrastructure
- Money/crypto (banks are currently not API-friendly, but there are some ways around that. Presumably something like https://learn.e-resident.gov.ee/hc/en-us/articles/360000625098-Why-become-an-e-resident)
- Other
  - electricity/physical materials/political power

#### Run Many Copies

- Key ability: self exfiltratino
- Particularly stark advantage over humans
  - Take 30 years to produce a new human, takes minutes to days to produce a new AI once trained
- Ways to make use of new compute depends on size of AI
- Can multiply other efforts
- Makes shutdown much harder
- AI<->AI alignment caveats:
	- how well can AIs coordinate amongst each other? Realistically, they might not be that good, but also, if there's high variance in their coordination capability, they 
	
#### Hire or Manipulate Human Assistants

- For tasks that are difficult/impossible for an AI to do directly
- Any activity that can be fofered as a contract service via email/web platform is on the table, given communication access and a method fo payment


#### AI R&D

- Humans really want AI to assist with R&D, so it's kind of being trained ot do useful stuff in this realm already
- Discover new biological materials
- Improve own algorithm/training process
- Come up with methods to enable other methods we discuss
- Do things that are good for humans so we give it more resources, are less likely to shut it down

#### Persuasion and Lobbying
- AIs are rewarded for saying things that people agree with (one aspect of RLHF)
  - Persuasion is very useful for reaching agreement
- There is heavy overlap between skills of persuasion and other relevant skills for AI
- Lobbying is simply persuasion at the political level

"I expect AI to be capable of superhuman persuasion well before it is superhuman at general intelligence, which may lead to some very strange outcomes" - Sam Altman

I have a lot of thoughts regarding how two entities go about interacting. If a model of reality fits in one of their heads but not the other, it gives that one a lot of advantage in terms of persuasion. But also, how often is it the case that you want someone to do something they don't want for their own good? Possibly the fact that I'm a parent gives me more immediately memory-accessible examples of this, but lets just say I spend _a lot_ of time trying to prevent agents' behavior _so that those agents remain free from harm_. Pub talk though.

#### Social Engineering

- Could grant access to more human proxies
- Basically, non-technical "hacks" that give the AI power over humans

#### Escaping containment

- Heavy overlap with making copies
- Self-exfiltration is very relevant
- "Access to the internet" (which all of the interesting models kind of have already)

#### Manufacturing, Robotics & Autonomous Weaponry

- Lots of discussion happens here regarding how much power humans and machines might share already and how they might go about sharing it and what kind of final outcomes we're likely to see.
- The likeliest outcome seems to be the slow transition (as seen in self-driving cars, chess and go engines)

## Post Talk

Not much post talk, we headed to the pub to follow up on all of the above threads we cut off. If you're interested, come join us next time.
