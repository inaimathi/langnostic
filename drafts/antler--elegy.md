If you recall, an earlier Antler notes piece said

> **Week 7** Is where you'll be asked to exit if there's judged to be no shot. Don't take it personally, but have it in mind, and see if you can put something together by then, or at least show the potential to be advised and put something together.

Well.

Week 7 just ended.

Of the ~70 people that started out with this program, 28 of us are left. I should note here; there's no intrinsic shame in this. Some of the people in the program, including some of the ones that have been cut, spoke about this as though it _would_ be shameful, or rough, or traumatic. The actual situation is: you worked hard, invalidated a bunch of ideas, and didn't pivot to anything within the 7 weeks that seems like it has obviously spectacular growth value, and you didn't find a solid co-founder inside of the timebox. This isn't a moral or competence judgement on you, but the investors realistically have to focus no people that _did_ manage those things. So, exit now and good luck with your next thing. No hard feelings, feel free to apply again for the next cohort.

No one got cut because they didn't work their ass off.

I'm honestly not sure how to feel about this. There's a bit of survivors' guilt mixed in there. And also an understanding that where I am now is in large part due to two or three really fortuitous events. I get that you make your own luck sometimes, and being where I am now is _also_ in large part due to grit and capability, but it's still uncomfortable how much space luck takes in the attribution breakdown.

I don't want to think _too_ deeply about it. Because honestly, right now I don't have the brain space to spare on that kind of thing, but I did want to register the point of reflection. My job right now, is to keep the luck flowing. So wish me more of it. I'll keep you posted on how it goes.
