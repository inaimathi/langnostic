## Your asks from Week 2

- More time for founder questions
- 

## Your Scores from Week 3

- All sessions were rated at 8/10

Specific feedback:
  - Most people said "just right" in terms of timing for founder pitches, but some said "too long", so we'll be more stringent about time limits on pitches. Also, we're testing something called "Slido" (pronounced: slide oh)
  - Adam's presentation emphasized being on top of trends
  - Shray's advice was practical based on his experience through Antler. Key takeaways were about being really responsive 
  - Appreciation for immersion in startup culture
  
## Your asks from Week 3

- VC metrics; a lot of you are interested in how VCs see you in detail and what their metrics are. We'll have an AMA with Alex Norman
- Office space at One Eleven could use improvement (requests for ergonomic chairs and desks). Out of Antler's reach, unfortunately. Also, apparently feedback from One Eleven _for us_ is overwhelmingly positive.
- Technical speakers; we're trying (couldn't make one happen this week because of)
- More networking - we won't be doing explicit things (because we also got a lot of feedback asking for _less_ programming), but we do have a spreadsheet of founders in this cohort. If there's anyone you haven't talked to yet that seems interesting, you should make a connection on slack.
- More goto market advice

## Key Takeaways

- Week 3 is a wrap; here's what you need going forward
  - We want to see action. Show week-over-week progress.
  - Be proactive and present in the office

  - Don't wait with tracking out, don't be too stuck on your idea.
  - Idea/validation is there for you to increase your likelihood of getting an investment. We are trying to save your, and our, time
  - There are 34 track-outs (including me :D)
  - There are still 36 founders looking for a team (including 7 founders that tracked back in)
