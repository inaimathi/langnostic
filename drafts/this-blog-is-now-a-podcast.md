So, as the title says, this blog is now also a podcast. It isn't listed in any podcatchers, although that might be [a next step](https://antennapod.org/documentation/podcasters-hosters/list-podcast) I guess? For now, you can click on a link entitled "listen to this post" above the text of each audiofied post to get an `ogg` file you can listen to.

For now, the readings are fairly basic and kind of on the robotic side, despite being pronounced in a deep, sexy, Croatian voice. I'm not done working on this yet though. Over the next little while, I intend to put my GPU to good use both in generating more readings, and in working to improve how existing ones sound.

As always, I'll let you know how it goes.
