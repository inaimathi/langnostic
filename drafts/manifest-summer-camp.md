The Manifest summer camp was a really fun experience. Deeply tech-hippie vibe. If you're into any of

- [manifold](https://manifold.markets/)
- [the rationalist community](https://www.lesswrong.com/)
- [serious computer science](http://compscicabal.github.io/)
- [ACX/SSC](https://www.astralcodexten.com/)

you wouldn't be at all surprised by what you found here.

Sessions from the first day included

- a morning run around Berkeley
- a game of [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/) in Aumann Hall
- a discussion of acceptable misaligned AIs in Bayes Attic
- a super smash brothers tournament. Possibly online?
- a Smores n' More evening session
- an attempt to solve alignment (sadly failed, but hey, we tried)

## The Campus

itself is amazing. It's the embodied stereotype, in the best possible way, of the quirky tech co-working space you've imagined Google having in the early days. I was worried that I wouldn't have wifi here. I needn't have. Every room has wifi login info, something fluffy and comfortable to sit in, an assortment of normal and standing desks, monitors, power, display cables, and books. The spaces have names like "Bayes Attic", "Eigen House" and "Rat Park" other obvious math/stats/comp-sci/rationalist nerd callouts (surreptitiously alphabetized for your convenience). 

The outdoor areas are a combination of garden path (real grass where possible, astroturf for high-traffic areas), but still manage the above combination of monitors/desks/power and wifi somehow. Oh, and the kitchens are all well stocked with coffee, tea, hot cocoa, soylent and various dairy-free milks along with organic versions of the usual. There is a scale model of the campus in one of the courtyards which is labelled "The map is not the territory... yet".

If I were a resident of Berkeley, I would absolutely, 100% be working out of here every day until they told me to stop.

## The conference 

went so _ridiculously_ fast. The stand-out memories, even from the vantage point of a day in the future are thoroughly entertaining. In no particular order:

- Finding an almost-complete pile of free Yudkowsky propaganda in paper format (they were out of HPMoR 1, unfortunately, but I have the rest of the series)
- Playing a Magic Cube game for the first time in like five or six years
- Going through four interesting Warcasting sessions that aimed to predict the outcomes/likelyhoods of ongoing/prospective armed conflicts. In order, we dealt with Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Hamas, China/Taiwan, and a potential (future) US Civil War. All intriguing, and the results will eventually be either up on Manifold or [here](https://nathanpmyoung.substack.com/).
- Getting a [Mana-chan](https://manifold.markets/manachan) shirt
- Eating a [_really_ good bagel](https://boichikbagels.com/) 
- Running through two Berkeley parks
- Seeing Robin Hanson walk by wearing a Bowser shell backpack
- Talking about various angles [on AI successors](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3kN79EuT27trGexsq/when-is-unaligned-ai-morally-valuable) while climbing a tree in the Feynman House Garden

## The Aftermath

I _think_ I ended up actually gaining time on the build? In the sense that the schedule gave me very few hours wall-clock to work, but concentrated so much productivity into what I got that I came out ahead in terms of code produced/bugs squashed/features completed. I still haven't caught up on notes _or_ audio for the blog though. There's an IOU there that I'll have to make good on at some point. Realistically, I'll post some thoughts on the _content_ of the conference/summer-camp over the next little while, get back into the note-taking groove over at [TASM](https://www.meetup.com/toronto-ai-aligners/), and go through [this book I got](https://www.amazon.ca/Fair-Exchange-Practice-Digital-Belongings/dp/1800615167/) in last week.
