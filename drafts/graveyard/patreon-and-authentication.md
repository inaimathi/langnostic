So.

As you [can probably see](https://github.com/inaimathi/langnostic/commit/5bad020314a2e30a12ac5c94b5cc0a7584497033), there's now a login link at the top right of the menu bar. You can use that to log in to the blog using your Patreon account. I'm working on extending that to Github accounts too, but baby steps, right?

At the moment, it does literally nothing other than display your username and thumbnail while you're browsing around, but I have some interesting ideas about how to make this work a bit better with the blog. The main big one is a comment system, for which I _might_ end up finally adding a database of some sort. Although I'm going to try like hell to make sure that the result is `git`/`github` compatible _somehow_. Whether that means committing a `sqlite` disk DB somewhere, or hacking together my own weird-ass on-disk comment system somehow.

I'll let you know how it goes.
