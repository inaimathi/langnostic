I'm debating whether to put my money where my mouth is regarding `prose`, or move forward with more stateful interactions. Ultimately, both of these things are going to be big and annoying. I _think_ that one of them gets me further along to where I'm going and the other is just a cosmetic conceit that I'm saving for when I need to give my brain a rest day.

So I mean, when you look at it that way...

## Mid Game

The early game of `The Prisoners` involves the player looking at things and making a series of [prisoners'-dilemma-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) decisions. Spoilers. The late game is going to be something completely different, but the _mid_-game I'm planning out is to let the player code their own strategies and run them in an automated way.

- Add interface to add strategies
- Add interface for running multiple prisoners

## Also, I couldn't resist...

...adding some prose expansions by starting up a basic description grammar. For now, it only generates names, but I _think_ I've been careful enough to make it generalizable enough for anything we might might need later.
