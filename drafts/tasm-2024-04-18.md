## Pre-Talk Chatting

- [Llama3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) has been released; this is a frontier model from Meta (Facebook) on the level of GPT4/Claude3/Gemini
- This is another open model, and yes, they released weights too
- "Open Source" models are contentious because some people want the training data and checkpoints, not just weights. The [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/) apparently did this, and some OS proponents think of it as the gold standard.
- Devin kind of sucks, actually? :/
- Future of Humanity Institute shuts down D: I think of this as "the Bostrom institute". Lasted about 19 years. Grapevine says that a big reason here is the amount of bureaucracy at Oxford (their academic institution).
- Dario Amodei was interviewed on the Ezra Klein podcast. Apparently interesting? Go listen to it.
