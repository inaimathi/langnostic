## Feedback

- Uniformly high scores on session feedback from previous week, with the exception of the Google presentation
	- Google presentation was
	  1. Too salesy
	  2. Didn't seem tailored to the current cohort
	  3. Could have used better use cases
	  4. The technical parts were too basic for the technical founders, and completely irrelevant for the non-technical founders
