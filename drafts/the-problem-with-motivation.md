So motivation is either intrinsic or it's not. You'll do stuff you want to do, or you'll do stuff that someone else makes you do. Really, you'd prefer to do stuff you want to do, but every once in a while, you need to do stuff that someone makes you do because it makes sense in context. There's a thing you may have heard of called money that's gotten press-ganged into the role of universal carrotstick, and cracks in this system are starting to show. It's not a problem with money; we actually kind of need that or something very similar to figure out how to interoperate nontrivially in large, distributed and-or decentralized groups (read between the lines of [The Router](TODO) for details) that have to deal with limited resources. And we have lots of distributed and/or decentralized groups that have to interoperate nontrivially, and there is always a limited resource.

The problem is with extrinsic motivation. If you can do stuff you want, or stuff someone else makes you, and you'd always rather be doing stuff you want, and you're surrounded by a pervasive system intended to make you do stuff, there's a bunch of failure modes you can fall into. The non-failure mode is

> Advancing our civilization as quickly and thoroughly as possible to one where no labour is necessary

If you don't agree with me that this is where we should be advancing to, then you're perfectly welcome to toil for the rest of your days and instruct your descendants to do the same. The rest of us would like an end to this Calvinist notion, and so long as you fuck right off with your demands that we accept your status quo, we can get along just fine as interoperable distributed and+or decentralized groups.

The failure modes are

## You are marginalized or dead

If you need to live, and in order to live have a certain baseline of supplies or funds, then you might find yourself in the situation where you don't have sufficient funds or supplies. If you find yourself in that situation, you are dead. Congratulations on your legacy, if any. If you find yourself _close_ to that situation, you'll find that it's fairly difficult to claw your way back out in the presence of the market. You'll find that you have to sell very close to all of your time at very low rates in order to secure a better life for your children (if any), and your intrinsic motivation will be bludgeoned to death under the weight of years upon years of soul-crushing work. This is the plight of most lower-income people.

## You half-ass your primary work in order to fund your secondary work

If you find yourself in the situation where the things you are intrinsically motivated to do don't suffice to pay you for the necessities of life, and you need to turn to more profitable but much less interesting tasks, then you'll arrive where most of the middle class has. In the place where you get your ass out of bed to go to an office you mildly loathe to do work that is uninteresting for you but profitable for some larger, disconnected entity, while your dreams either languish or are pushed to the margins of the workday or into the sparse vacations you get to take. This is a comfortable, gilded, quasi-desirable soul-crushing hammer, but it's still a soul-crushing hammer.

## You forsake intrinsic pursuits for extrinsic ones

If you want to function in a particular way, that's cool. And if you want to forcibly change how you function, that's likewise fine. The problem is that there's a seemingly large population (I've encountered enough of them that they're either prevalent locally or constitute a non-trivial general presence) that seems to actively seek out extrinsically motivated pursuits at the expense of intrinsically motivated ones. The carrot is too tempting for them, and they end up doing silly things in its service. This is a non-optimal scenario for a subtle reason; they _would_ be more motivated to do the things they wanted to intrinsically. Those fields their heart occupies would be advanced faster and more meaningfully than the fields they're forced into. The species is still gaining by pushing its' population this way, but it's gaining in a painfully suboptimal fashion. We can do better. We _ought to_ do better. The _how_ is eluding me.

# The How

- what's our current extrinsic motivation framework?
- can it be tweaked nontrivially without collapsing?
- if so, are there tweaks we could make in service to our goals?
- if not, what would it take to build a better framework?
