_Note: This post was _really_ late. I've been taking time to do more programming than I've done since my younger startup days. As I write this note, we've concluded Week 7, and I plan to do a reflections post on that shortly, but right now I'm playing catch-up with various Antler and TASM notes. Sorry, kinda not sorry._

## Sharing discovery

Context free notes from various presentations.

- Not everyone wants to grow. At all. Some people just want to solve the problem in front of them and not think particularly further
- Big pharma is most interested in de-risking potential drugs (they frequently don't research lesser known molecules themselves, but are very happy to license appropriate tech from smaller labs once those labs have done groundbreaking work)
- Computational chemists are rare and extremely expensive, so getting one on your board is a pretty strong signal
- Keep in mind that if you've got a lot of calls that you got from a particular platform listing, that platform may be affected by selection bias
- Parents mostly don't want to hear feedback or get help, they mostly just want reassurance (that they're doing ok, or that they're not the only ones facing a particular problem)
- The kids are alright
- A couple groups re-derived ["Awkward Silence" and "Tell me more"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/12/34/)
- College students are surprisingly willing to just talk to random old people on campus
- Pricing is weird. Certain verticals just have an assumption that the service is really expensive, so when you tell them what you're looking to sell something for, a common reaction is a sort of "that's too good to be true" suspicion
  - Potential solution is a "try now pay later model"
- Giving freebies is a good way to get peoples' attention (assuming they're actually valuable freebies)
- Some people haven't fully internalized the [typical mind fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy), and are pretty surprised when they see evidence for it
- Sometimes, your idea sucks, and that's ok. You can drop those and move on to better ones.

## That's It For Now

This sub-series has been a set of notes that I furiously typed out during the various Antler sessions in a similar style to how I cover the TASM group. There's been _a lot_ of positive feedback on various private channels, including a surprising number of people asking me if I was using some sort of transcription+LLM setup to compile notes so quickly. The answer is no; I type them with my human fingers and try to think quickly enough to wring out insight as I go. As with the rest of this blog, half the point is me working ideas through my brain and seeing what sort of nutrients I can extract.

The curriculum is done now, and most of us are in [build-or-sell](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/powz47JL3tY?si=V1x8Qoa7j6JHCiRW) mode. There will _probably_ be more posts [tagged Antler](https://inaimathi.ca/archive/by-tag/antler), but they'll be notes on progress, or possibly links to stream VODs of me writing ridiculous amounts of JS/Python in [my now-bizarre dev setup](https://github.com/inaimathi/machine-setup/).

I'm planning to take a little time off, both to work on the main build, and to do some touch-ups to [catwalk](https://github.com/inaimathi/catwalk) so I can resume/fully-automate the audio versions of this blog.

Wish me luck, and as always, I'll let you know how it goes.
