## Minor team notes

- Expectation is to find a co-founder within the next two weeks
- There are some pre-formed teams (some of them are looking for a third, some aren't; just be mindful of that)
- Data shows, if you're here, showing up and giving it your all, it'll work out. If something comes up, let us know, but otherwise be here and attend.

### Phase 1 Overview

- Week 1-5 are dedicated for team formation and idea generation
- Week 3-9 advisory and build
- Phase 1 Activities:
  - Speaker sessions (like the Kirk Simpson keynote from yesterday)
  
**Week 7** Is where you'll be asked to exit if there's judged to be no shot. Don't take it personally, but have it in mind, and see if you can put something together by then, or at least show the potential to be advised and put something together.

- Once you track out (form a deliberate team and start moving forward), there are specific steps in [Antlerhub](https://hub.antler.co/) you need to take in order to formalize this. No worries right now, just keep in mind that there's a process. If you didn't come part of a pre-built team, you can track out as early as day three.

### Lessons from Previous Cohorts

- "Go straight at the people I would like to track out with, and tell them clearly: I want to track out with you".
- "Figure out your values and chemistry, as you work on problem ideas"
- Trajectory slide is reiterated. It's _normal_ to work on an idea, then pivot, track out with someone, then track back in, then track out with someone else. You don't have to be moving at anyone elses' cadence.

### Snapshot of 10 weeks at Antler (from Ezee Assist)

- Two business co-founders, found their tech founder in week 1, do 500 customer outreaches (~10% response from cold outreach)
- Week 2 they wanted 60 customer calls (40+ brands covered)
- Week 3 they wanted a fully functioning prototype
- Week 4 20+ customer demo calls
- Week 5 6 interested in a pilot
- Week 6 4 pilot committed
- Week 7, 8, 9 secured pre-seed funding

This is an atypical, but possible trajectory. They had the advantage of having done team formation/chemistry exploration and customer outreach before their Antler cohort started.

### Antler Expectations and practical tips

#### Our Expectations

- We're a VC, we're here to invest in the strongest founders
- We're a lean team
- Antler residency is not a school (we aren't here to teach, we just give you a sandbox to help you focus)

#### Your Expectations

- You're here to build a startup. Be focused on that. 
- Actively listen to everyone because you never know where you'll find your co-founder and build your network.
- If you see something, let us know (I think this is interpersonal weird stuff)

#### Tips

- Be prepared for group sessions, presentations and office hours
- Go at your own pace (again, as noted in the trajectory slide, you're not all going to be running at different schedule)
- Participate, work hard
- You get out what you put in

# PSA

IF YOU ARE SICK, STAY HOME

It's not worth the FOMO, connect virtually for what you can. Support each other and maintain your routine.

Maintain your health, and the health of the cohort

## Finding your Co-Founder

- Do you need a co-founder?
  - Data-wise, yes. In descending order of founder team-size, the most common unicorns come from 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10 person teams. 
    - No details on the 10 person team, and I have no idea how you go about getting anything done with a responsibility base that diffuse. Maybe this was like a bunch of sales peeps, and sales is really parallelizable once you have your product set up?
- Antler are advisors, not board members. So if we advise you to zig and you zag, that's fine if it works for you.
- Your initial ~$150k should last you about 8 months

- Why startups fail:
  - No market need (42%)
  - Ran out of money
  - Co-founder blow-ups (Altman says this is the most common fail mode in YC)

- Different ways founders have formed teams at antler:
  - Netnow: founders met at antler, had a new idea together (this is the most common story)
  - Glassbox: Founder with idea recruited for their team at antler
  - Chexy: Pre-formed idea, pre-formed team added a third cofounder outside of antler
  - ProCo (now "Easy Assist"): pre-formed team of two who then matched with third at Antler

- Advice:
  - Give yourself a large luck surface area; talk to and work with everyone (this is a classic [explore/exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration-exploitation_dilemma) tradeoff)
  - Get to know everyone, and remember: communication is really - really! - important
  - Make sure you're transparent with your partners and expect same
  - Talk about your values, talk about your personal values, talk through difficult questions early on (good general principle here; if there's something that frightens you, go ~~face~~ talk about that first.)
  - Trust your gut if it has a strong pointer
  
- The timeline to track out on average is 3 weeks. Some people track out immediately, some founders get to 7 weeks before tracking out (either planning to go solo, or find another founder)
- Once you've tracked out, you get a coach

### FAQ

- What if I don't track out by week 3?
  - Don't get too nervous about it. People sometimes track back in, but also, some of the big success stories end up tracking out in weeks 7 or 8.
- What happens if I track back in?
  - Basically keep going. If you've got time, try again.
- Can I bring in a cofounder from outside the cohort?
  - Yes, and it can work, but it tends not to (and they have a preference for in-cohort founders)
- Will Antler communicate to us if they don't think we are a good fit?
  - Yes. We won't force you to go into any directions, but we will speak with candour if there's something we thing you're obviously missing
	
### Q&A

- Is there any situation where you'd recommend someone bring on a third founder?
  - Yes, we've recommended that to Genuine Taste, because they were a pair of business founders. They didn't do that, and it ended up working for them.

### Anyone want to share a breakup story?

- A: We had a startup situation where one of the founders was a professor that ended up wanting 50% of the equity. They weren't contributing anything other than some of the IP, but still wanted a controlling stake. This was a hard breakup because of the respect dynamics and also the IP situation, but they ended up splitting over this.
- B: Co-founder ended up pursuing more career opportunities, which involved her moving away to a country I knew wouldn't let her keep her commitments. And I ended up being right, not too messy a breakup, but I had to have some tough conversations.
- C: Missed this one because I was refreshing my memory on [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), sorry :|
- D: I advise you all to talk to a lawyer, and make sure you _know_ what your shareholder agreement means. Make sure you know what you're getting into. Are you planning to IPO? Are you planning to sell? Are you doing a family business where you're going to build out for 20ish years and then pay yourself dividends?

## Epilogue

There was a keynote, but I got burnt out on note taking after the founder intros and just listened this time. I might write up a condensed meditation on it later.

Honestly, the big lessons I ended up remembering after the fact are:

1. Don't care about Antler right now, focus on company growth, do what's best for your company.
2. Don't hire anyone until you absolutely must. In particular, junior coders are no longer worth it given how much productivity CoPilot gives an experienced generalist (note to self; get a [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) account, I guess. [I've found ChatGPT to be a decent but not game-changing](https://inaimathi.ca/posts/ai-development-assistant-quickie) addition to my toolkit, so I don't have high expectations)
3. Validate your market hypotheses. _Fucking validate them_. Talk to any potential customers immediately, take all of their feedback right now, and don't to-the-hilt an idea unless someone literally throws money at you for it. You should feel a firm and slightly plasticky impact somewhere on your face. The implication was that you should write exactly zero code until you've done this; I'm not convinced, but that's possibly because my rate is high enough that code is pretty cheap for me. YMMV.

It's tempting to dismiss each of them with sophistry, but this is advice from people interacting with the territory. Dismiss at your own peril.
