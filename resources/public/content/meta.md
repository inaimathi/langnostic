## About Me

I'm a "Graphic Designer" (graduated from [OCAD](http://www.ocadu.ca/) with a bachelor's) specializing in illustration and web development. Also, I like programming, and learning languages. Which is why I'm here.

Currently, I'm working as a senior device engineer at [Raydiant](https://www.raydiant.com/), mostly doing Clojure, Python, Javascript, Shell, C and Golang work (in order of preference, rather than quantity, sadly).

## About This Site

This site was built out of parentheses and higher-order functions. The site itself is just over 300 lines of relatively readable Clojure, which I still plan to refine over the next couple of weeks. There's still no database; just some [`markdown`](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [`JSON`](http://www.json.org/), processed and then served up by [`http-kit`](https://http-kit.github.io/).
