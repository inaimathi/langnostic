# TipJar

So. You've read a bunch of my crazy-ass ramblings, and you're abuzz with energy that you'd like to convert into action. Here's what you can do...

### Support My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/langnostic)

I'm [langnostic](https://www.patreon.com/langnostic) there, because someone else got `inaimathi`.

Right now, it's just you handing me spare change, but I'm planning a few things that might be interesting shortly.

### Discuss

Submit my posts to the appropriate content aggregators and comment on them. I won't tell you which posts or aggregators, but pick out whatever you find interesting enough to discuss and discuss it. I wouldn't mind being poked, just so I can answer questions if they come up.

### Tip these folks

The [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate), the [FSF](https://my.fsf.org/donate/), and [a choice piece of Lisp infrastructure](https://www.quicklisp.org/donations.html) all do good, necessary work, _and_ could probably put your money to better use than I would.

### Feed My Habits

I use some services that provide subscription bonuses.

Specifically, [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76), [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.ca/c/leoz1320) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/?exp=hp-c). So if you're considering signing up for any of them, click [here](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=445ca16e1a76) for DO, [here](https://www.airbnb.ca/c/leoz1320) for AirBnB, or use the Uber invite code `leoz602ue` to give both of us a free kick in the appropriate service.

### Hire Me

If you've got the need for a programmer for a 5-to-30-hour-long project, are fine with it being built in some Lisp, Python or ML flavor, think I might be able to handle the challenge, and can pay my hourly rate, get in touch with me and give me something interesting to hack on.
