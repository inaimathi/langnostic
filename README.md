- Currently written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) (formerly in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), formerly in [Go](http://golang.org/), formerly in [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/)).
- Serves posts from the `.md` files found in [resources/posts/](https://github.com/Inaimathi/langnostic/tree/master/resources/posts/), so you could theoretically just read it from this repo (but it seems like it would be a pain in the ass to figure out which post is supposed to be the latest)

## ToDo

- Revisit old blogs. NOW AT: `id:93`

- `BGG Data Sifting` is MIA. All the cl-notebook articles have issues with the translation-from-markdown approach. `cl-notebook` obviously needs an export-to-markdown feature.
