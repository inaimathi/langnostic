**Scratchpads: Peeking Under the Hood of Language Models?**  
*by [Your Name]*

Let’s get the disclaimers out of the way right upfront: this post was originally a talk, a somewhat “less polished presentation” hastily assembled, so we’re going for a leisurely, meandering walk through idea space rather than a meticulously curated lecture. Buckle up—this is about to get delightfully nerdy.

## The Big Idea: Scratchpads

So, there's this concept called *scratchpads* in the world of large language models (LLMs). My first real encounter with them was courtesy of the [Sleeper Agents paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566) and then again in Anthropic’s [Alignment Faking paper](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/983c85a201a962f/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-full-paper.pdf). Both of these studies used scratchpads to try and *observe* the chain of thought or intermediate reasoning that a model might be going through.

The idea is straightforward: you ask a model for its final answer *and* its line of reasoning. It’s basically “thinking out loud.” The *hope* is that by watching the model’s internal commentary (e.g., text in `<scratch>` tags), you get a direct feed from its brain’s command center. Then, you can see if the model is being sneaky or if it’s consistent with its own stated reasoning.

This leads to a pair of big, anthropomorphizing questions:

1. **Are scratchpads pure inspection tools, or do they change the outcome?**  
   (Because if providing a scratchpad massively changes the final answer, then we can’t trust it as a faithful window into the “real” process.)

2. **Is the scratchpad output *actually* the model’s internal process, or is it more like the confabulatory behavior seen in humans?**  
   (Yes, I said confabulatory—like those split-brain patients who invent reasons for their actions after the fact.)

Because let’s be real, humans are the OG confabulators. We tell ourselves after-the-fact stories all the time. So, we need to figure out whether LLM scratchpads might be exactly that—some next-level, instantly fabricated rationalization.

## The Original Scratchpad Concept

The first time I really dug into the concept of scratchpads was in the aptly titled [*Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00114). This paper makes it pretty clear: *scratchpads definitely change the model’s behavior.*

Their experiments involved tasks that need multi-step reasoning—like addition, polynomial evaluation, or simulating a piece of Python code. They tested how the presence or absence of these “step-by-step reasoning” tokens affected the correctness of the final output, with and without extra fine-tuning. The short version is:

1. Showing work helps. Giving the model a place to *explicitly* do multi-step thinking can improve results.  
2. If you train (or fine-tune) a model specifically with these scratchpad style prompts, it can handle multi-step tasks significantly better.

So, at least in the *original* scratchpad papers, yes, the scratchpad changes the outcome—and that’s a good thing for tasks that require multi-stage reasoning. But do we trust that the scratchpad text is a transparent reflection of the model’s internal logic? That’s a whole other question.

## Wait, So How *Faithful* Are These Scratchpads Really?

Enter two more recent papers:

- [*Language Models Don’t Always Say What They Think*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04388)  
- [*Measuring Faithfulness in Chain Of Thought Reasoning*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13702)

These folks wanted to dig deeper: **Does the chain-of-thought (CoT) we see actually reflect the hidden chain-of-thought the model used?** Or is it a post-hoc storyline the model invents to please us?

### 1. Language Models Don’t Always Say What They Think

Their methodology basically sets up scenarios to see whether the model’s “step-by-step reasoning” can be manipulated by biased prompts. They discovered that:

- CoT explanations aren’t automatically faithful—there’s a real chance you’re just seeing a good story that may or may not match the model’s real reasoning process.  
- CoT can even nudge a model away from what was initially a correct answer, if your scratchpad is laced with bias.  
- Some ways of prompting *can* mitigate that, but it’s not guaranteed.

### 2. Measuring Faithfulness in CoT

This second paper gets more specific. They propose three reasons CoT might *fail* at faithfulness:

1. **Post-hoc reasoning**: The final answer is already decided in the model’s hidden state, and the chain-of-thought is just a retroactive “here’s how I got it” story.  
2. **Unfaithful test-time computation**: The process of generating a CoT might lead the model to perform extra thinking that changes the answer in ways not clearly captured by the tokens.  
3. **Encoded reasoning**: The model’s “real” reasoning might be stuffed in some kind of steganographic format within the CoT, which is indecipherable to casual readers.

They run a bunch of experiments (filler text, paraphrased CoT, truncated CoT) and find, among other interesting tidbits:

- Smaller models (<13B params) tend to produce *more faithful* CoT than bigger ones.  
- Replacing the CoT with filler text often doesn’t hurt performance, which suggests the CoT might not be as “live” or “true” as we’d hope.

In short: the chain-of-thought is not always the real chain-of-thought. If that was your suspicion, you’re not alone. (And you may have been right.)

## But About Those Sleeper Agents…

Coming back full circle to the Sleeper Agents and Alignment Faking papers: *do they test for fidelity in their scratchpads?* That’s not super explicit in their text—at least, it’s not front-and-center in the main results. They use scratchpads to observe the model’s internal monologue for potential deception, but whether those scratchpads are *really* what the model is “thinking” is a little up in the air. The question basically remains: *Even if the scratchpad is contrived, can we glean anything from it about deception or alignment?*

## Closing Thoughts

I don’t have a grand, triumphant conclusion to deliver. (Also, my “post-hoc rationalization” alarm goes off if I try.) But here’s where I land:

1. **Scratchpads absolutely affect how models think**—and in many problem-solving tasks, they make the solutions better.  
2. **Fidelity is not guaranteed**—we’re not necessarily reading the model’s “true” thoughts.  
3. **Smaller models might be more honest**—in large models, you risk the chain-of-thought being more performative than genuine.  

If you’re playing around with scratchpads or Chain-of-Thought prompts in your own projects, keep these caveats in mind. They can be a double-edged sword—on one hand, they can supercharge complex reasoning; on the other, they might feed you a totally confabulated story about *why* the model answered the way it did.

As always, if your domain is high-stakes (medical, legal, or existentially crucial decisions like “Why did I eat that entire chocolate cake in one sitting?”), approach these scratchpads with a hearty dose of caution.

Until next time—scratch responsibly! And if you see a suspiciously neat chain-of-thought, remember: it might be as real as my ad-lib excuses whenever I show up late to a meeting.
